        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This app was developed as a tool to help manage RP (role-play) lotteries held in the Velvet Pearl. It is purely an administrative,
            assisting tool and does not contain any purchasing logic or otherwise money-affiliating tools.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Connectivity & data</h3>
        <p>
            The app stores data online. If the phone is not connected to the internet the data will temporarily be stored on the phone and synchronized
            when next internet access is established.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
            A lottery--and the app--consists of four main concepts:
            <ul>
                <li>Lottery meta data</li>
                <li>Tickets</li>
                <li>Lottery numbers</li>
                <li>Prizes</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Lottery meta data</em> specifies the price of each lottery number, the range of available numbers, and indentifying information (name and created date) of the lottery.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Tickets</em> contain a given number of purchased lottery numbers and have a (named) associated owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Lottery</em> numbers are the numbers available for purchase in the lottery, and the ones that are drawn from when winners are determined.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Prizes</em> are the named prizes that can be won in a lottery.
        </p>
